Before we begin, make sure that you have installed the R Markdown package. Use the following command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

Here `eval = FALSE` is used to ensure that this R chunk is not evaluated when the document is generated.

## Introduction to R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Control Flow Structures

Onto the lab!

### Conditional Expressions

If-else statements are perhaps the simplest type of control flow structure:

```{r}
x <- 1 # Change this value!
if (x > 0) {
  print("positive")
} else {
  print("not positive")
}
```

Of course, the else is not necessary (if you don't want anything to occur otherwise), or you can chain multiple if-else statements:

```{r}
y <- 1 # Change this value!
if (y > 0) {
  print("positive")
} else if (y < 0) {
  print("negative")
} else {
  print("zero?")
}
```


Your turn!
Write R code that will "squish" a number into the interval [0, 100], so that a number less than 0 is replaced by 0 and a number greater than 100 is replaced by 100.

```{r}
z <- 100*pi
# Fill in the following if-else statements. You may (or may not) have to add or subtract else if or else statements.
if (TRUE) { # Replace TRUE with a condition.
  
} else if (TRUE) { # Replace TRUE with a condition.
  
} else {
  
}
```

If you find yourself using many if-else statements with identical structure for slightly different cases, you may want to consider a switch statement instead.

```{r}
# Convert the day of the week into a number.
day <- "Tuesday" # Change this value!
switch(day, # The expression to be evaluated.
  Sunday = 1,
  Monday = 2,
  Tuesday = 3,
  Wednesday = 4,
  Thursday = 5,
  Friday = 6,
  Saturday = 7,
  NA) # an (optional) default value if there are no matches
```

Switch statements can also accept integer arguments, which will act as indices to choose a corresponding element:

```{r}
# Convert a number into a day of the week.
day_num <- 3 # Change this value!
switch(day_num,
  "Sunday",
  "Monday",
  "Tuesday",
  "Wednesday",
  "Thursday",
  "Friday",
  "Saturday")
```

Your turn again!
Write a switch statement to determine if a given lowercase letter is a vowel. Assume that "y" is not a vowel.

```{r}
letter <- "e" # Change this value!
switch(letter,
  a = "vowel") # Modify as necessary.
```

### Loops

Loops are used when you want to perform a given task many times.

The simplest type of loop in R is the repeat loop, which will repeatedly evaluate a set of expressions until it is told to stop.

```{r}
# Divide a number by 2 until it becomes odd.
val_rep <- 898128000 # Change this value!
repeat {
  print(val_rep)
  if (val_rep %% 2 == 1) { # If val_rep is odd,
    break                  # end the loop.
  }
  val_rep <- val_rep / 2 # Divide val_rep by 2 since val_rep was even.
  # When the end of the loop is reached, return to the beginning of the loop.
}
```

Often you will want to perform a loop until some condition is satisfied, or as long as a condition as satisfied. In that case, a while loop may be more appropriate.

```{r}
val_while <- 898128000 # Change this value!
while (val_while %% 2 == 0) { # Continue the loop as long as val_while is even.
  print(val_while)
  val_while <- val_while / 2
}
print(val_while)
```

Notice that the while loop code is more compact (ignoring the print statements), since the stopping condition has been encoded in the loop itself.

Your turn!
Write R code which multiplies a positive number by 3 and adds 1 until the result is greater than 10000. For example, 2015 -> 6046 -> 18139. Write both a repeat loop and a while loop.

```{r}
n_rep <- 314 # Change this value!
repeat {
  break # Replace this with your code.
}
n_while <- 314 # Change this value!
while (FALSE) { # Replace FALSE with your stopping condition.
  # Fill in.
}
```

Sometimes instead of performing an action until a condition is satisfied, you just want to perform it a specified number of times. In these cases, a for loop is appropriate.

```{r}
for (i in 1:10) { # Repeat 10 times.
  print("Hello world!")
}
```

Your turn again!
Write a for loop to add 1 to every element of a vector.

```{r}
vec <- c(3, 1, 4) # Change this value!
for (j in c()) { # Replace c() with an appropriate sequence.
  # Fill in.
}
```
